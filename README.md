# FullStack Coding task
### Installation guide
Main repo ``npm install`` would install necessary dependencies into both ``api`` and ```client``` folders.
Then ```npm run dev``` will spin up the local ``dev`` environment. 

Client application runs in ``http://localhost:5173/``

API runs in ``http://localhost:3000/``

Build is enabled as part of ```npm run build```
and the respective `dist` will be available in the ``api`` and ```client``` folders.

### Side note
* Din't get a chance to do unit/integeration testing
* I didn't attempt the second part of the question. If you don't mind we can have a live paring session on our call
